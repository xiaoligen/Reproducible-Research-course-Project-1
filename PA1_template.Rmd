
## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Load the data:
```{r loaddata, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/12150/Desktop/activity.csv", header=TRUE)
```

2. Show the original data:
```{r showdata, echo=TRUE}
head(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


1. Subset the original data to calculate the total number of steps
```{r stepsByDay, echo=TRUE}
stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps~date, data, sum)
head(stepsByDay)
```

2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r histogram1, echo=TRUE}
hist(stepsByDay$steps, col = "red"
     , xlab = "Steps", main = "Total Number of Steps Per Day")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r mean1, echo=TRUE}
mean1 <- mean(stepsByDay$steps)
mean1
median1 <- median(stepsByDay$steps)
median1
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Subset the original data to calculate the average number of steps taken of the 5-minute interval
```{r averageSteps, echo=TRUE}
averageSteps <- aggregate(steps~interval, data, mean)
head(averageSteps)
```

2. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r plot1, echo=TRUE}
with(averageSteps, plot(interval, steps
                , type="l", main="Average number of steps taken in 5-min interval"
                , col = "blue")) 
```

3. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

Max data is:
```{r max, echo=TRUE}
max <- max(averageSteps$steps)
max
```

The interval contains max data is:
```{r intervalmax, echo=TRUE}
subsetData <- subset(averageSteps, steps == max)
subsetData$interval
```

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```{r missing, echo=TRUE}
colSums(is.na(data))
```

2. Create a new column "newSteps" contains the average steps in each interval
```{r newsteps, echo=TRUE}
data$newSteps <- averageSteps$steps
head(data)
```

3. Fill in the missing data
```{r fill, echo=TRUE}
data$steps[is.na(data$steps)] <- data$newSteps
head(data)
```

4. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
```{r newdata, echo=TRUE}
data$newSteps <- NULL
newdata <- data
head(newdata)
```

5. Subset in the new data set to calculate the total number of steps per day
```{r sumdata, echo=TRUE}
sumdata <- aggregate(steps~date, newdata, sum)
head(sumdata)
```

6. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r histogram2, echo=TRUE}
hist(sumdata$steps, col = "blue"
     , xlab = "Steps"
     , main = "Total Number of Steps Per Day (with the missing data filled in)")
```

7. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r mean2, echo=TRUE}
mean2 <- mean(sumdata$steps)
mean2
median2 <- median(sumdata$steps)
median2
```

8. Calculate the differences of the mean and median between the first and second part
```{r diff, echo=TRUE}
mean2 - mean1
median2 - median1
```
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


1. Install and load the timeDate package

Please install the package first:

install.packages("timeDate")
```{r load, echo=TRUE}
library(timeDate)
```

2. Create a new column, and use the isWeekday() function to check if the date is weekday or weekend
```{r check, echo=TRUE}
newdata$Weekday <- isWeekday(newdata$date)
head(newdata)
```

3. Subset and calculate the average steps for weekday and weekend

Weekday
```{r weekday, echo=TRUE}
weekday <- subset(newdata, newdata$Weekday == "TRUE")
weekdayMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = weekday, mean)
head(weekdayMean)
```

Weekend
```{r weekend, echo=TRUE}
weekend <- subset(newdata, newdata$Weekday == "FALSE")
weekendMean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = weekend, mean)
head(weekendMean)
```

4. Make the panel plot to calculate the average number of steps taken for weekday and weekend
```{r panel, echo=TRUE}
layout(matrix(c(1,1,2,2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
plot(weekdayMean$interval, weekdayMean$steps
     , xlab = "interval", ylab = "Number of steps"
     , main ="Weekday", col ="blue", type="l") 
plot(weekendMean$interval, weekendMean$steps
     , xlab = "interval", ylab = "Number of steps"
     , main ="Weekend", col ="red", type="l")
```
